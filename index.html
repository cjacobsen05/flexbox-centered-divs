                <p>I'm originally from Vermont and though I moved away, I still think of it as home. I grew up on a river, with the green mountains on every horizon, surrounded by rolling hills of farmland dappled with pockets of forests. It was an ideal place to grow up and I love going back to visit. </p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>Now that I live in a city, I miss being able to get outside and enjoy the four seasons of the northeast. In Vermont during the winters, I'd ski and snowshoe. From spring through summer and into fall, I'd hike, kayak, and bike. There's nothing as peaceful or refreshing as taking in the beauty of nature.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Living in a city has brought me a lot of new experiences, and I've made many good memeories here. I'm eager to see and do more, travel to new places, and make more memories. But nowhere will ever hold the same place in my heart as a house set back from a dirt road in a tiny town of northern Vermont.</p>
